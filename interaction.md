The correlation graphic above and interaction network below each illustrates how various departments/divisions within the corporation share similar climate risks and the consequences to their operations. If two departments/divisions shared the same language for defining a risk, these were counted as an interacting risk value. Colours in the correlation matrix above correspond to the number of correlation and the interactive plot allows for easy identified of departments that have overlapping risks. The network interaction below illustrates the top three departments/divisions that share similar risk statements with other sections in the corporation.  The thickness of the line represents the number of shared risks between department/divisions.
