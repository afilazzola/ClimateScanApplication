The ordination figure above illustrates divisions that are closer together as having similar rankings for respective consequences. If a department/division frequently ranked a consequence as high, the department/division would orient more closely to that text. This graphic thus illustrates trends of association among both departments/divisions and consequences. Using this graphic can help highlight opportunities for collaboration among departments/divisions that share concerns for the same consequences.
